I recently purchased [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) as part of the pack with [Voxatron](http://www.lexaloffle.com/voxatron.php) and have been playing around with it.

It's been great fun creating waves and a basic boat which responds to user input.  Definitely going to play with it more and see what this turns in to.  I would highly recommend checking PICO-8 out.
