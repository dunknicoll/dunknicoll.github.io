My good friend, [Mr John Catto](https://twitter.com/Jonny_Catt_), and had always been chatting about making a game together and, off the back of a piece of pixel art he did based of a voice/character in one of the many excellent videos by [Stumpt Gamers](https://youtube.com/stumptgamers/)

SO

In my never ending quest to keep active in game development and maybe one day actually finish something I've been slowly working away at getting this game together.

The artwork from John is absolutely fantastic. Such a skilled artist.
